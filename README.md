In this project , we have used a number of classification models to classify the text that is Emergency or not.
All the process has  step-by-step description.
process :
1: Loading dataset
2: EDA.
3: Cleaning text.
4: Tokenization.
5: Lemmatization method.
6: Using both CounterVectorizer and TI-IDF.
7: Using classification models.

There are two techniques which are used : 1- TF-IDF     2-CounterVectorizer
The accuracy is the same as using  LSTM .
I hope you like.
